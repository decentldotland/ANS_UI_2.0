# The hackathon ended!

# Build social with Arweave data
## [decent.land](https://decent.land) x [Hacker House](https://twitter.com/hackerhouse_cn) mini-hackathon

Starting September 19th, the ar.page hackathon is open to all developers! Use a stack of identity tooling built on Arweave and EVM to build better web3 social.

ar.page is a cross-chain social identity aggregator. All your blockchain info and activity for Arweave Name Service (ANS) users, stored in one place.

## ar.page, Ark, and ANS

Arweave Names Service (ANS) is an identity and social metadata protocol built on Arweave. It is the username layer of decent.land as well as a human-readable proxy for wallet addresses, supported by [ViewBlock](https://v2.viewblock.io/)

ar.page, the ANS profile explorer, is a specifically designed to be expanded with useful data views, built as individual components.

The decent.land Ark API is able to return on-chain activity on Arweave and EVM chains, token holdings, NFTs, DAO memberships etc., for given ANS user identities.

**…with all of that data combined, there’s a lot the [ar.page](http://ar.page) dApp could show about a user!**

## Quickstart

1. Check out [this user profile](https://xy.ar.page) on ar.page
2. GET and inspect [the Ark API response for that user](http://ark-api.decent.land/v1/profile/arweave/kaYP9bJtpqON8Kyy3RbqnqdtDBDUsPTQTNUCvZtKiFI)
3. Come up with an idea based on the data that the API **does or does not** return. What's missing from the API? What's missing from the UI?
4. Fork this repo (or the [Ark repo](https://github.com/decentldotland/ark-network)) and code your idea
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/p/xy (or /p/any_username) to access a profile on localhost

## Goals

The goal of this hackathon is to use ANS and Ark to display interesting insights about Arweave users on [ar.page](https://ar.page) - build a new UI component, integrate a new data source, or enrich data we already have.

How can we slice and transform a user's on-chain data and display it in a way that they'll want to show off?

The specifics are open-ended, but **here are some ideas** we think would be awesome for the Arweave ecosystem and beyond.

### Ideas to build

- Make it possible to mint a new image into your collection without leaving the page -- use img.arweave.dev (the current way Collectibles is populated), relying on [their repo](https://github.com/twilson63/permaweb-img-app/tree/atomic-tx) for inspiration and instruction 
- Add the option to choose an NFT you own as your profile picture instead of uploading a file; add a border to the NFT when it's the user's pfp, to show it's verified
- Improve the design of the modal that triggers when a Collectibles item is clicked, and display more of the available metadata
- Add badges to show DAO and PSC membership
- Add ERC-721 NFTs to the Collectibles tab -- this data is already present in the Ark API
- Aggregated tweets or other linked social web3 data sources like Mirror.xyz
- Make it possible to [STAMP](https://stamps.live) assets from the Collectibles tab
- Add more ways to get verified status with [VouchDAO](https://vouchdao.xyz) or with [ArNS](https://ar.io/arns) name linking (note that ArNS is totally separate from ANS, despite the similar name)
- Expand existing components (e.g. build search and filters into the activity feed or collections view)
- Build components for subsections of a user’s collection, e.g: all of their metaverse land, all of their ANS names…
- Show a user's [permacast](https://permacast.dev) podcasts or Pianity tracks with the [weave-aggregator](https://github.com/decentldotland/weave-aggregator)
- Implement an activity feed which reads all of a user's activity from the weave-aggregator
- General performance optimizations to the [API](https://github.com/decentldotland/ark-network) and UI

## Rules

- Submissions must be your own original work
- Submissions must be a fork of this repo ([ANS_UI_2.0](https://github.com/decentldotland/ANS_UI_2.0))
- The component built must be shown in the context of ar.page, with a link to the live functioning, and running instance of the app itself, as well as a link to the repository it is stored within.
- Submissions must be open source, with the full source code available on GitHub or another open code hosting site. Feel free to use whatever OSS licence you prefer.
- All submissions must include a brief description of the application and functionality in the GitHub repo.
